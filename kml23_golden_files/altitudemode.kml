    In order to preserve backwards compatibility, Earth needs to
    provide both <altitudeMode> and <gx:altitudeMode>, that way
    old clients that don't understand the seafloor/bathy data
    can still display something reasonable.

    KML 2.3 would need to provide the same mechanism, to provide
    backards compatibility with old clients. Hence, the creation
    of <seaFloorAltitudeMode>.
