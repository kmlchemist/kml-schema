<h4><a name="extensions"></a>Extending SQC Plugin to Handle Other
Extensions</h4>
<p>By default, the SQC Plugin only processes files with "xsd", "wsdl" or
"xfm" extension. In order to process files with other extensions,
you would have to create a new plugin which provides extensions to
the following extension points:</p>
<ul>
<li> <b>org.eclipse.ui.popupMenus</b> &#151; It is an extension
point defined by Eclipse Workbench allowing you to add
"Validate with SQC" item in the popup menu when a file with
your extension is selected. Note that, in your plugin manifest,
the "class" attribute of &lt;action&gt; element must be set to
"com.ibm.etools.sketch.sqc.SQCAction"</li>
<li> <b>com.ibm.etools.sketch.sqc.fileExtension</b> &#151; This extension
point allows you to specify SQC options (as you would for
<a href="use-commandline.htm">the command line</a> driver)
to use to validate files of a given extension.</li>
</ul>
<p>The creation of this plugin only requires that you create a new
plugin manifest file like
<a href="pluginExtensionExample.xml">
pluginExtensionExample.xml</a>. To install your new plugin,
you will have to create a new directory, MyPluginDir say, in
EclipseDirOrWSADDir/plugins (where EclipseDirOrWSADDir is the
directory where Eclipse or WSAD has been installed). Then put the
plugin manifest at <i>EclipseDirOrWSADDir</i>/plugins/MyPlugin/plugin.xml
and restart Eclipse or WSAD.</p>
