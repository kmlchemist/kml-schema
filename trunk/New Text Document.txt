Notes:

Best practice guidance
 1. Add new extension elements in diff ns with different behavior instead of adding new attributes 
     example uom ft vs m issue
 3. Orthogonal metadata e.g. accuracy, xml
 
Questions:
 1. External schema:  <import namespace="urn:oasis:names:tc:ciq:xsdschema:xAL:2.0"
    schemaLocation="http://docs.oasis-open.org/election/external/xAL.xsd"/>

 2. <schema> element, not an object
 3. Second minor revision of anyAttribute additions - check OGC rules.
 4. Enum vs CodeList pattern
 5. Extension group naming conventions  
        a. ObjectExtensionGroup vs ComplexExtensionGroup?
	b. just two kinds of Extension Group? simple and complex or a 3rd to separate simple vs simpleContent vs complexContent (and more specifically complex content derived from Object)

one extension group (anyType)
 pros 
  - simpler (few choices) for extension mechanism
 cons 
  - can't enforce types and kinds of extensions (e.g. Object typing)
  - different from past
 
two extension groups (simpleContent, Object/ComplexContent) 

three extension groups (simpleType, simpleContent, Object/ComplexContent)
